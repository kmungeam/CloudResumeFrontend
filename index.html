<h5><strong>The Cloud Resume Challenge</strong></h5>
    <p class="project">The Cloud Resume Challenge gave me an opportunity to use AWS features such as S3, Route53, DynamoDB, Lambda, Certificate Manager, Cloudfront, 
        and API Gateway. Beyond AWS, we learned to register and connect a domain purchased outside the system, 
        create a Github Repository, and to use Terraform. This followed sections on networking, which provided me with tools
        to better troubleshoot and navigate the project. To learn more about my experience, <a href="https://medium.com/@keelymungeam/cloud-resume-challenge-e1a511df30ce">check out this blog post!</a></p>
